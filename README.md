# [Project 1 - Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning](https://github.com/minesh16/AAA-Capstone-Project)
- Used **K-Means Clustering to perform customer segmentation**. Used elbow method for selecting # of clusters and intercluster distances were validated with Yellow Bricks framework.  
- Predicted probability of purchasing a product using **Logistic Regression**. Imbalanced dataset was factored into by using 50/50 data split. 
- Implemented **Gradient Boosting Regression** model to predict usage and costs incurred per customer. Recursive Feature Elimination & Cross Validation (RFCEV) technique was used to improve model accuracy.
